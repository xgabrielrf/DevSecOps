# DevSecOps

The **Docker Security** talks about docker security in general. The information has gotten by [Docker Bench Security](https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security) and [Docker Security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/).

On the other hand, **Exploiting Vulnerable Images** show how you can attack a container that is not using the **Docker Security** information. It was gotten from this Udemy course: [Hacking and Securing Docker Containers](https://www.udemy.com/course/hacking-and-securing-docker-containers/).


> More information about DevSecOps will be here soon.
